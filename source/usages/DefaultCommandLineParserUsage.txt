NAME
       pird - rip audio data from a disc or a disc image

SYNOPSIS
       Print out a help message:

           pird -h

       List available devices, disc images in DIR or content of FILE:

           pird -l [DIR | FILE]

       Extract audio data from FILE:

           pird [OPTION...] FILE [-]

DESCRIPTION
       Rips audio data from a disc (CD-DA or CD-ROM Mixed) or a disc image
       (TOC, CUE or NRG). Supports (automatic) device calibration and result
       validation against accurate rip database[1].

OPTIONS
       There are some options to tell pird how to proceed:

       -f, --format FORMAT
           Sets the audio FORMAT to use for output. Available FORMATs are: WAV
           (default) and PCM.

       -j, --job, --jobs JOB[,...]
           A JOB describes what data should be ripped. If no JOB is specified,
           pird rips the whole disc. Multiple JOBs are delimited by ,

           There are different types of JOBs:

            1. Rip a single track.

               TRACK_NUM

            2. Rip a range of tracks. A range is specified by either two dots
               (include right bound) or three dots (exclude right bound).

               TRACK_NUM..[.]TRACK_NUM

            3. Track numbers can be followed by a timestamp, which indicates
               where to start or stop reading. NOTE: A second consists of 75
               FRAMEs.

               TRACK_NUM[[MIN:SEC.FRAME]]..[.]TRACK_NUM[[MIN:SEC.FRAME]]

            4. If one side of a range has no bound, pird reads from the
               beginning of or to the end of the disc.

               TRACK_NUM[[MIN:SEC.FRAME]]..

               ..[.]TRACK_NUM[[MIN:SEC.FRAME]]

       -p, --paranoia
           rip in paranoia mode (makes only sense if FILE is an optical drive)

       -s, --speed SPEED
           Sets the SPEED to use for reading: 1x, 2x, 4x, ...

           NOTE: Single SPEED means a data transfer rate of 150 kB/s.

       -t, --together
           do not split ranges at track bounds

       -x, --swap-bytes
           swap bytes (should be used if the byte order of read data is wrong)

       -a, --accurate
           validates rip result against accurate rip database

       -c, --calibrate
           calibrates the device by ripping the first track and validating
           ripped data against accurate rip database (trying all known
           offsets)

       -o, --offset OFFSET
           Calibrates the device with an offset (+/-) of OFFSET samples.

           NOTE: A sample is four byte (two short values).

       -v, --verbose
           be verbose, each occurrence increases log level

       -q, --quiet
           be quiet

       -d, --dry-run
           simulate execution of jobs

OUTPUT
       By default pird writes all audio data read by a job trackwise to the
       current working directory. Option --together can be used to suppress
       splitting audio data at track bounds.

       If the last parameter is a dash -, the audio data of all jobs is
       written to stdout.

RIPPING DISC IMAGES
       Support of TOC format is limited in libcdio versions prior to 0.90, use
       CUE format instead. Conversion can be done with toc2cue, which is part
       of CDRDAO, Disk-At-Once Recording of Audio and Data CD-Rs/CD-RWs[2].

EXAMPLES
       Rip audio disc in /dev/cdrom writing each track to a separate WAV-file:

           pird /dev/cdrom

       Rip audio disc in /dev/cdrom to a single WAV-file:

           pird -t /dev/cdrom
