USAGE:
  Print out a help message:
      pird -h
  List available devices, images in DIR or content of FILE:
      pird -l [DIR | FILE]
  Extract audio data from FILE:
      pird [OPTION...] FILE [-]
   
OPTIONS:
  -j, --job, --jobs JOB[,...]
      A JOB describes what data should be ripped. If no JOB is specified,
      pird rips the whole disc. Multiple JOBs are delimited by ,
      There are different types of JOBs:

      1. Rip a single track.
           TRACK_NUMBER
      2. Rip a range of tracks. A range is specified by either two dots
         (include right bound) or three dots (exclude right bound).
           TRACK_NUMBER..[.]TRACK_NUMBER
      3. Track numbers can be followed by a timestamp, which indicates where
         to start or stop reading. NOTE: A second consists of 75 FRAMEs.
           TRACK_NUMBER[[MIN:SEC.FRAME]]..[.]TRACK_NUMBER[[MIN:SEC.FRAME]]
      4. If one side of a range has no bound, pird reads from the beginning
         of or to the end of the disc.
           TRACK_NUMBER[[MIN:SEC.FRAME]]..
           ..[.]TRACK_NUMBER[[MIN:SEC.FRAME]]

  -f, --format FORMAT
      The audio format used for output.
      Available formats are: WAV (default) and PCM.
  -t, --trackwise
      split ranges at track bounds
  -p, --paranoia
      rip in paranoia mode (makes only sense if FILE is an optical drive)
      NOTE: This feature isn't implemented yet!
  -v --verbose
      be verbose, each occurrence increases log level
  -q, --quiet
        be quiet
  -s --simulate
      simulate execution of jobs
 
EXAMPLES:
  Rip audio disc in /dev/cdrom to a single WAV-file:
      pird /dev/cdrom
  Rip audio disc in /dev/cdrom writing each track to a separate WAV-file:
      pird -t /dev/cdrom
