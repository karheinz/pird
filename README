***** NAME *****
pird - rip audio data from a disc or an image  

***** SYNOPSIS *****
Print out a help message:
    pird -h
List available devices, images in DIR or content of FILE:
    pird -l [DIR | FILE]
Extract audio data from FILE:
    pird [OPTION...] FILE [-]
 
***** DESCRIPTION *****
    Rips audio data from a disc (CD-DA or CD-ROM Mixed) or
    an image (TOC, CUE or NRG).  

***** OPTIONS *****
There are some options to tell pird how to proceed:

-j, --job, --jobs JOB[,...]
    A JOB describes what data should be ripped. If no JOB is specified,
    pird rips the whole disc. Multiple JOBs are delimited by ,
    There are different types of JOBs:

    1. Rip a single track.
         TRACK_NUMBER
    2. Rip a range of tracks. A range is specified by either two dots
       (include right bound) or three dots (exclude right bound).
         TRACK_NUMBER..[.]TRACK_NUMBER
    3. Track numbers can be followed by a timestamp, which indicates where
       to start or stop reading. NOTE: A second consists of 75 FRAMEs.
         TRACK_NUMBER[[MIN:SEC.FRAME]]..[.]TRACK_NUMBER[[MIN:SEC.FRAME]]
    4. If one side of a range has no bound, pird reads from the beginning
       of or to the end of the disc.
         TRACK_NUMBER[[MIN:SEC.FRAME]]..
         ..[.]TRACK_NUMBER[[MIN:SEC.FRAME]]

-f, --format FORMAT
    The audio format used for output.
    Available formats are: WAV (default) and PCM.
-t, --trackwise
    split ranges at track bounds
-p, --paranoia
    rip in paranoia mode (makes only sense if FILE is an optical drive)
    NOTE: This feature isn't implemented yet!
-v --verbose
    be verbose, each occurrence increases log level
-q, --quiet
    be quiet
-s --simulate
    simulate execution of jobs
 
***** OUTPUT *****
By default pird writes all audio data read by a job to a single file in the
current working directory. Option --trackwise can be used to split audio data
at track bounds.
If the last parameter is a dash -, the audio data of
all jobs is written to stdout.  

***** EXAMPLES *****
Rip audio disc in /dev/cdrom to a single WAV-file:
    pird /dev/cdrom
Rip audio disc in /dev/cdrom writing each track to a separate WAV-file:
    pird -t /dev/cdrom
